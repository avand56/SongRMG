% Rupture Model Generator (RMG), based on 1-point and 2-point statistics of earthquake source parameters
% SongRMG Version 2018.04 
% Reference: Song & Dalguer (2013, GJI), Song et al. (2014, GJI), Song (2016, GJI)

% File structure 
SongRMG.m	=> main script

% Input
gen_src.m 	=> basic description for source model 
gen_stats.m 	=> set up target 1-point and 2-point statistics
gen_stats_inp.m => automatic setup for 1-point and 2-point statistics

% Rupture model generator
gen_rup.m	=> generate rupture models (main subscript)	
gen_dist.m	=> reproducing target 2-point statistics 
gen_rho.m	=> input coherence structure for 'gen_dist.m' 

./FastMarching/code/fm.m  => compute rupture time with rupture velocity by FastMarching algorithm (M. Buehren)

gen_svf.m	=> generate slip velocity function
svf_pliu.m	=> generate pliu SVF (Liu et al. BSSA, 2006)
svf_etinti.m    => generate etinti SVF (Tinti et al. JGR, 2005)

% Output
gen_srf.m	=> generate SRF files (SRF: Standard Rupture Format by R. Graves)

% Utility
b_taper.m => tapering slip distribution near fault boundary

fmomentN.m  => compute Mo and Mw from slip dist.
fMo2MwN.m   => Mo => Mw
fMw2MoN.m   => Mw => Mo

p_rup.m   => plotting simulated ruptue models
p_mrf.m   => plotting moment rate function and its spectrum
p_p1.m    => analyzing 1-point statistics of simulated rupture models
p_p2.m    => analyzing 2-point statistics of simulated rupture models
