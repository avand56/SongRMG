% SongRMG Version 2018.04 
% Reference: Song & Dalguer (2013, GJI), Song et al. (2014, GJI), Song (2016, GJI)

% Notes
3) Moment rate function is added 
2) 2-Point simulatin is performed with coarse grid, then fine grid data
are obtained by interpolation (Sept. 2015)
1) The code is modified to generate random hypocenter locations
for SCEC BBP Part_B tests (October 2013)


% File structure 
SongRMG.m	=> main program

% Input
gen_src.m 	=> basic description for source model 
gen_stats.m 	=> set up target 1-point and 2-point statistics

% Rupture model generator
gen_rup.m	=> generate rupture models (main subscript)	
gen_dist.m	=> reproducing target 2-point statistics 
gen_rho.m	=> input coherence structure for 'gen_dist.m' 
trans_dist.m    => transform 1-point statistics (from normal to target dist., currently not used)

gen_rupT.m	=> calculate rupture time from rupture velocity
gen_svf.m	=> generate slip velocity function
svf_pliu.m	=> generate pliu SVF (Liu et al. BSSA, 2006)
svf_etinti.m    => generate etinti SVF (Tinti et al. JGR 2005)

% Output
gen_srf.m	=> generate SRF files (SRF: Standard Rupture Format by R. Graves)
